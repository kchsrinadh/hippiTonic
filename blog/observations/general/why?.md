# Why ?


The warmth of mother,

The care of father,

The Sky high dreams,

The Silly friends and stupid laughs,

The Endless exploring world,

The peaks of Lows and the Highs of joy.

Huffff….



Think you are 80 yrs old.

Looking back these memories with content and smile.

I feel, Wow thats hell of a ride….

Then One day, you die.



But,

Why ?

What for all these ??



I seek, I order, I beg, I mad, I yearn, I cry, what not..

No matter the case, answer doesn’t seem to emerge.



Should I accept defeat or fight for it .. . don’t know…



Can one teach ant, Quantum theory ?

Can one teach human, Universe ?

Don’t know..



It seems though the entire life on this planet is trying to become a better intelligent being..

Generation by generation… even the intelligence is passed on in genes…



Will I or my future gene..

In one of the life times become intelligent enough ?



Is the only thing that can answer this Why is time ?
